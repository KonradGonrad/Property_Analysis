## Introduction

Hello,
The goal of that project is to: 
- create a analysis of the prices in some city in Poland, in our case in Lodz, based on mainly the otodom (and olx) site. Determine how season impact the price of the listings and how location impacts the price from specific destinations, like some galleries or universities.
- check the prices of selected types of apartments along different months in year, how does the prices change within a different months, or with different parameters, like number of rooms.
- predict or determine the price of the apartment with specific characteristics.

This project will be simmilar to the previous one [project](https://github.com/KonradGonrad/real_estate_analysis_project) I've created earlier, but i didn't finish it.
I'd like to take care of that project for the next 1 year, to carry out the complete analysis of the prices along whole year.

In this repository, I'll post the code, which everyone will be able to use for the educational purposes, with their own dataset.
